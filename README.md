# Casino-Roulette
Casino Roulette is an all virtual version of the actual casino gambling game, Roulette. The most important aspect of this game is player's luck. Player is allowed to put chips on any numbers and/or various options on the table. Once all bets have been made, the dealer will drop the ball onto the rolling wheel. From then on, the player can only hope that the ball will land on a number and/or option he/she has placed a bet on. If the player is lucky, he/she gets that specific chip back as well more chips as a reward for placing the correct bet. If he/she is unlucky, they will lose that chip for good. The player is allowed to play as long as their balance holds money (chips). Or they can cash out whenever they like.

I built this project in order to demonstrate my skills on the various JavaScript tools we have covered in class thus far. Roulette being such a simple looking game but so complex behind the scene makes this game a perfect choice of a project. This project allowed my to use my logic and put it into works to make the game fully functional.
<br>
Because I have played Roulette before and emjoy playing Roulette, I was able to set my game expectations as clearly from the perspective of a player as possible. As a gambler, I want to walk up to the table with random amount of chips provided by the developer. I want to place my chips on any number/options on the table and program recognizes where I have placed my bet. When I click spin, I want the ball to roll on a random number. I want my balance to increase/decrease based off my bets and the lucky number which the ball rolled on. I want to continue increasing my balance for as long as I want and be able to cash out and go home when I want. If I lose and run out of money, I want the webpage to alert that I have lost all of my money and restart the game. 
<br>
In order to give the player a random amount of chips, I used the Math.random() function and gave player a random amount of $ up to $100. 
<br>
To make sure that a player can put their chips on any valid choice on the table, I created buttons with an Opacity of 0 for every single betting choice on the table. Then I created Opacity of 0 chips for each button and placed them directly above each button. From then on, I created various functions and eventListeners to link the buttons to their corresponding chips and change opacities of the chips upon user clicking the corresponding buttons.
<br>
Everytime a player spins the wheel and is lucky, their balance amount increases. I was able to do this by first counting the number of clicks that have been made on each button. Since a player can place multiple chips on the same button, clicks needed to be counted for a correct payout value. Then, I multiplied the number of clicks by the chip amount ($5) and then multiplied that by the payout value (35, 17, 2 to 1, even, etc..). I did this for all of the buttons. If a button was clicked, it would have a click amount greater than 0. Using if statements, I was able to compare the lucky number with every single button and make the value increase/decrease based of number of clicks and rest of the previously mentioned function. 
<br>
The game is fully funcional now as it is but I have leared of a few things I would implement into my project next time around. First of all, I would place my chips as a child of each button and use event.Target to identify which button was clicked and have the related chip appear on the page. This would allow me to make my code much shorter. Secondly, I would animatins to my alert boxes or replace it with something else on the screen. I would also like to add a spinning wheel with animations showing exactly which lucky number the ball has rolled on. I will be able to do this soon after covering sections on various APIs, framewords, and other JS tools.
